# Thrust-Stand-Project

The goal of this project is to develop a modular thrust stand capable of recording force data of small solid rocket propellant motors. The goal of this project was to develop a better understanding of solid rocket propellant motors, as well as use this thrust data to investigate how many motors our team would need to implement for the final rocket design.

## Description

The project covers the electronic architecture behind the thrust stand. The software and hardware of the system will be covered, as well as the how to use the system safely and correctly. Experimental thrust data of a C6 solid propellant motor is also compared to a referenced model.

NOTE: This project must be handled with extreme caution, as it involves the ignition of a solid propellant motor. Keep humans and flammable objects away at a safe and large distance when the stand is under operation. Do not operate in small spaces. Tests for this project were conducted in open spaces with special permission.
